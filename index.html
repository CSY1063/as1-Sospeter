            <h1>A bit more about me...</h1>
            <p>I am a web developer currently based in Northampton. I love working on new projects and building software applications from scratch. I have always had and artistic and creative side, which has led me to design several sites over the years. My skills date back to around 2020 where I started making simple games using C++, and along the way I gained an interest in the web.</p>

            <h1>Site Report</h1>
            <p>This is my personal portfolio project for assignment 1 submission. I used inspiration from two portfolio websites where tried to incorporate some of the grid styling and layout of the pages. It took me about 4 weeks to complete the entire project as I ran into different bugs along the way. I used tools such as stackoverflow which is a website commonly known to developers where answers to common problems are usually answered.</p>
